# 212project
This is the github for my 212 final project on matter power spectra. FINAL_growth_function.ipynb is the notebook for the growth function calculations, including comparisons with CLASS. ehu_transfers.ipynb is the notebook to calculate the Eisenstein-Hu transfer functions using the steps outlined in my final writeup.
